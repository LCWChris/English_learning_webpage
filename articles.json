        "Content": "Doctors at Cambridge University said hip-hop can help depressed and mentally ill people. 'Hip-hop therapy' uses hip-hop songs to reach out to people with emotional problems. Doctors wrote a report about this in a medical magazine. They said hip-hop music speaks of getting over hardships and big difficulties. Hip-hop talks about being poor, unpopular, and about crime and drugs. These are all problems that can lead to depression and mental illnesses.\nThe report says hip-hop artists describe their world to be free. There's a message of hope in the lyrics. They describe how they want to live – the cars they want and the people they want to date. They chose five songs. One is by Grandmaster Flash. Another is called 'Juicy' by The Notorious BIG. He tells people they can be successful even if others say they cannot. BIG says teachers told him he would be nothing, but then he became a superstar."

The idea was from Archbishop Krajewski. He met a homeless man and invited him to dinner to celebrate his 50th birthday. The man said no because he smelled bad. The man explained to the archbishop that finding food in Rome was easy. He said Rome needs places to wash.\nConstruction of the showers will start soon. There are plans to make another ten showers across Rome. Krajewski asked for volunteers and donations. He needs soap, towels and clean underwear. He told reporters: \"It is easier to prepare sandwiches than to run a shower service. Journalists asked him if he thought visitors might be offended by the showers for the homeless.  The archbishop said it is the church's duty to serve the poor and needy."

McDonald's said: \"McDonald's USA does not source GMO potatoes, nor do we have current plans to change [that].\" The company did not say anything about McDonald's decision.\nFrench fries are very popular around the world, especially in fast food restaurants. French fried potatoes were in a cookery book in 1856. A little later, 'French fried' meant 'deep-fried'. People say French fries come from Belgium and not France. Belgians say the word 'French fries' is popular because France has an image for good food. Some people think the word 'French' was used after U.S. soldiers went to Europe during World War I."

A wife will care more for her sick husband. A wife also stresses if she cannot look after her husband.\nResearchers studied the health of 1,200 married people aged 57 to 85. They asked the couples questions about marriage. They asked if they spent free time with their partner. They also asked if they could trust their spouse, and whether their spouse asks them to do too many things. Doctors compared the quality of the marriages with the number of heart attacks and strokes people had. People in bad marriages were more depressed and had higher blood pressure."

        "Content": "A report says American children are safer today than they were 20 years ago. The study is from the Child Well-Being Index, which has been made since 1975. It measures the quality of life among US children. The best figure is that child death rates have gone down by a third since 1975. Suicide rates among teens have fallen and fewer children experience violent crime. Teen births are at their lowest level in decades. Children are also better educated today.\nThe report highlighted some negatives. Child health has worsened. A major cause of this is obesity. Teenagers are spending longer indoors using technology. This may protect kids from physical dangers outdoors but can harm their health. Child poverty still affects millions of children. This has not changed in the past 20 years. About 20 per cent of children lived in poverty in 2013. This is about the same as it was in 1995."

Relations worsened last week when former Russian ally Ukraine tried to join NATO.

It said it would look at how ready Ukraine is to join the alliance. It would do this in the same way as with any other country. A spokeswoman said: \"This is an issue between NATO and the individual countries aspiring to membership.\" She added that Russia's actions in Ukraine broke international law and threatened European security."

Doctors say this is \"light at the end of a dark tunnel\" for many families. Britain's leader said parents who want a healthy baby could now have one.

By 2060, nearly 40% of people in Japan will be over 65. They already make up 25%. The birth rate fell from 4.54 children per mother in 1947 to just 1.42 in 2014."

The professor said rich people break rules and laws, and do not care about others. He also said they cheat more at games. He said wealth makes you think only about yourself, your goals and things you want. These are the most important things in life for rich people.\nThe professor said poorer people are more generous than rich people. They give one-and-a-half times more of their money to help others. He said the richer you are, the less generous you are. Rich people can change and become nicer and more generous. They can help others more if they know that giving and helping is good. The professor said when rich people know how good giving is, they will give as much to others as poor people."

It is the world's biggest water system. It has many problems. Too many people want too little water. Farmers say they need it most because they grow food. People in the cities say they need it to live. People who own golf courses and swimming pools also use a lot of water. California’s population will be almost 50 million in the year 2020."

Drivers are twice as likely to die on these than in towns. Many deaths are preventable. The charity asked drivers to stop overtaking on country roads. It said: \"Why risk it and rush? You could cause a devastating, high-speed, head-on crash that ends lives.\" It said a \"significant minority\" of aggressive and selfish drivers still overtake, and that \"cool-headed and responsible drivers\" do not."

        "Content": "Egypt's president attended a ceremony to open an extension of the Suez Canal. The original canal, built in 1869, took 10 years to build. The new canal was built in 12 months. Experts said it would take five years. The canal joins the Mediterranean and Red seas. The president sailed up the canal in his yacht to attend the opening. The same yacht was the first ship to sail through the canal a century-and-a-half ago. The new canal is Egypt's \"gift to the world\".\nEgypt hopes the canal will boost the economy. The head of the Suez Canal Authority said it was important Egypt earned money from its waterways in the future. He said: \"If I can't handle this and turn it into revenue for [Egypt], alternative routes will emerge.\" He hopes revenue will increase to $13.2 billion by 2023. That means shipping traffic must double by 2023. This needs a 9% increase in global trade. Some economists doubt if this will happen."

An international labour organization said youth unemployment is coming down in rich countries, but is rising in Asia, the Middle East and Brazil. In China, it was 10.6 per cent last year and could be 11.1 per cent in 2016. In Brazil, the figure has gone up by 2 per cent this year.\nIt is very hard to be young and starting out in today's labour market. It is worst for women. The highest youth unemployment is for women in the Middle East. This figure is around 45 per cent. One big reason for youth unemployment is the global financial collapse of 2008. Many countries still have problems. Youth unemployment doesn't just affect the economy. It also affects health, peace and people's happiness."

However, a new report says this ecotourism damages nature more than it helps it. Researchers believe tourists stop animals behaving naturally in their natural habitat. Recently in Costa Rica, turtles had problems laying their eggs because of the many tourists who were on the beach to watch them.\nThe report says that ecotourism is making animals bolder. Animals who often see humans will become tamer. They become less cautious about other animals. This puts them at risk of being attacked by their natural predators, so more of them will be killed. The report also said it was essential to understand more about how different species respond to humans, and how this might put them at risk."

People suffer from bad coughs, fever and weight loss.\nResearchers say that many of these diseases can be stopped. TB affects old people who do not have enough to eat. A UK doctor said she did not understand why society didn't do more to fight TB. She said: \"Malnutrition is preventable. It is totally unacceptable that…there are at least one million older people malnourished or at risk of malnourishment.\" She said there should be a bigger focus on better nutrition and proper medicine."

TP4 is carried by the wind, water, cars and people's feet. A small amount of TP4 spreads across large areas very quickly.\nBefore the Cavendish banana, we ate a variety called the Gros Michel. Fifty years ago, it was the world's main banana. By 1965, a fungus called Panama Disease had killed it. Banana growers changed to the Cavendish banana. Now the Cavendish is in trouble. TP4 stays in the ground for a long time, so new plants cannot grow. One answer is to grow genetically modified (GM) bananas. Diseases like TP4 cannot kill them."

It is also called near-sightedness. It is when things that are far away from us are difficult to see. There will be seven times more people with myopia in 2050 than there were in the year 2000. Today, almost 90 per cent of young Chinese people and up to 95 per cent of teenagers in South Korea are near-sighted.\nThe researchers said this increase was because of different things. Looking at computer screens and mobile phones could be a big reason. The rise may be linked to lifestyle changes resulting from spending less time outdoors. A science journalist said spending time outdoors in early childhood reduces the chances of getting myopia. A researcher of the report advised: \"You could spend a long time [on] computers and screens, but also spend two hours outdoors.\""

People who do not sleep enough eat up to twice as much fatty food.\nResearchers created two different situations with 14 volunteers. In one, the volunteers averaged 7.5 hours of sleep.

The patients had heart problems after birthdays, weddings, favourite sports teams winning, and the birth of grandchildren.

A newly published journal says many of these medicines may have serious side effects. These include cognitive damage, dementia and even brain shrinkage. This happens in older adults who take OTC medicines for asthma, aches and pains, insomnia and allergies, etc.\nResearchers from Indiana University looked at the link between OTC drugs and brain function in older people. The scientists found that OTC drugs lower our glucose metabolism, so the brain isn't as healthy. The research gives us a better understanding of the brain and \"ways that might raise the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia\". A researcher said she would not tell her grandparents to take OTC drugs unless they had to."

These are the areas where a river meets the sea, and the freshwater and saltwater mix. The reef covers an area of 5,800 square kilometres. It stretches from the French Guiana coast to the Brazilian rainforest. Reefs are rarely found in rivers because the water is usually too muddy. It also does not contain enough salt.\nThe scientists explored just 10 per cent of the reef. They found 73 species of reef fish, some carnivorous. They also found sponges, creatures and other marine life that had adapted to life in the dark water. A researcher said: \"We brought up the most amazing and colorful animals I have ever seen.\" However, the area will be explored for oil. The researcher warned that the impact of ocean warming and oil exploration will put the whole system at risk."

Men rated each male voice for levels of dominance. Women rated them for romantic attractiveness. Men also rated women's voices for attractiveness. Most men thought the deeper male voices belonged to a more dominant man. Dr Puts said the pattern of the women's ratings did not suggest that the deepness of the male voice was so important to females."

He looks human, but is a little ugly and could come from a horror movie. The BBC says: \"He has a head shaped like a boulder, feet snarled like tree roots and a chest like a wrinkled battering ram.\" Graham was designed to highlight how easy to damage the human body is in a car crash.\nTAC asked artist Patricia Piccinini to create Graham. She worked with a leading trauma surgeon and a road crash expert to get Graham's look. She gave Graham a thick skull, a wide neck, an inflatable chest, and legs that allow Graham to jump quickly. TAC explained why Graham is an educational tool. It said: \"Cars have evolved a lot faster than humans and Graham helps us understand why we need to improve…our roads system to protect ourselves.\""

People do not want more native birds to become extinct. Rats and other predators that arrived 300 years ago have killed many different birds.

Babies aged four-to-11 months old who ate peanut products were 70 per cent less likely to get a peanut allergy.\nEgg and peanut allergies are the two most common childhood food allergies. Parents must be careful because babies can choke on whole nuts. They should also only eat smooth peanut butter. Other food allergies are to soy, wheat and seafood. Giving these foods to babies one at a time may protect them. Parents should check their baby's health after each new food. More research is needed to find the best ages to start giving eggs and peanuts to babies."

A top modeling agency says male models get 75 per cent less than female models. The agency said women could get $52,000 for a fashion show, while men can only get $13,000. It's perhaps the only industry where men get paid less than women but it's not equality for women.\nThings are changing and pay is getting better for men. Advertisers are promoting men's fashion. More male models are being used because men are taking more care of themselves. They spend a lot of money on their hair, moisturizer and make-up. One good thing for men is that they can work as a model for longer than women. They make most of their money in their 30s. Female models make most of their money in their twenties."

If you combine these with the different ways of making coffee, there are a lot of numbers. The mathematicians had to use many complex calculations to find the perfect method. Researchers focused on what happens to coffee as it goes through coffee machines.\nThe research could change the way coffee machines are made. A researcher said he wanted, \"a complete mathematical model of coffee brewing that you could use to design coffee machines, rather like we use a theory…to design racing cars\". Coffee lovers might soon be able change the taste of the coffee as they filter and brew it. They could change the water temperature, the size of the ground coffee, the length of time needed to make it, and more."

Photosynthesis is the when plants use sunlight to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. This lets us breathe. The scientists found a way for plants to use the energy they get from sunlight better. Professor Stephen Long said his team is changing the genes in crops such as rice, wheat, maize and soybean.\nThe scientists changed the thing plants use to protect themselves from the Sun. Plants turn energy into heat when they get too hot. However, they do this even when it is cloudy. The scientists put copies of the heat-loss gene into plants. These help plants to quickly return to using energy to grow. Professor Long said if crops can produce 20 per cent more food, it will help the food supply in the future."

One is that no gravity means fluids float in the body, so the brain changes position and size. The findings could help doctors to treat people with problems caused by long-term bed rest. They could also help those with a build-up of fluid in the brain, which can lead to brain damage. We will understand more about how neurons in the brain connect.

Insulin breaks down sugar in the blood. People with diabetes have too much sugar in their blood. They have health problems and can die. People with type 1 diabetes do not produce any insulin. People with type 2 diabetes do not produce enough, or it has no effect. Scientists said fasting increased the amounts of insulin. They said the tests were promising and now needed to be done on humans."

They wanted to find out what affects their sleep. They found that having children in the house leads to less sleep for mothers. This negatively affects her daytime energy levels. The study found that fathers' sleep was mostly unaffected by having kids in the house.\nChildren are the biggest cause of mothers not sleeping. Dr Kelly Sullivan said each child increased a woman's risk of not sleeping by 46%. Just half of mothers under 45 with kids at home said they got seven hours of sleep a night. This figure was 62% for mothers with no kids at home. A lack of sleep is harmful. It increases the risk of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and depression. Dr Sullivan said we needed to help mothers get the rest they need."

BNR made a deal with the copyright organization. It will now pay more royalties – money given to artists every time it plays their songs.\nIn the past two months, the number of listeners to BNR's shows went up by 20 per cent. It seems listeners like listening to older music like Bulgarian folk tunes, classical music and pre-war jazz more than Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift. BNR might change the music it plays. The boss of BNR, Aleksandar Velev, said there could be new radio stations. He said current radio shows will not change, but there will be new shows with different types of music."

They include love letters, photos, videos and fake identities. The conmen then pretend to be looking for love on dating sites. The conmen write to their victim and when they become friends, they ask for money. They give many different excuses and reasons why they need money.\nLondon police said 3,900 people got scammed online in 2016, mostly women. The average amount of money lost was $12,500. The average age of the victims was 59. A police officer described the damage the scams do to people's lives. He said the emotional damage is usually bigger than the lost money. He said people should never give money to strangers online, even if that person tells a very sad story. People should always be on their guard."

These include not photographing people without asking, not going into their gardens and not dropping litter. Tourism is booming and the number of tourists will rise by 50% in the next decade.\nOld Holland looks like the past. There are windmills and traditional wooden houses. A local resident said the village of Zaanse Schans is like an open-air museum. However, he said: \"One resident…opened his curtains in the morning and looked into the camera lenses of nine photographers.\" He added: \"Visitors seem happy to knock on the wooden houses to see if it is real wood….That is not pleasant.\" He said tour buses were the noisiest."

It said an extra kilometre run by friends can inspire someone to run three-tenths of a kilometre farther, and an extra ten minutes run by friends can inspire someone to run three minutes longer. Social media improved slower, less in shape runners, and those who were showing signs of overtaking a friend. If you run more, it is likely that you can make friends run more."

        "Content": "A report says fitness trackers don't measure the calories we burn while exercising so accurately. This means people may be making poor decisions about their diet. Researchers looked at five popular trackers, including the Apple Watch. The researchers observed 60 volunteers as they walked, ran and cycled. None of the devices had an error rate below 20 per cent. A researcher said the trackers only gave \"rough estimates\" for calories burned.\nThe scientists said people should be careful about using the devices to decide what to eat. A researcher said: \"If you go to the gym, and you think you've lost 400 calories, then you might feel you've got 400 calories to play with.\" A CEO of a fitness tracker company said the study method could have used incorrect settings, which would give incorrect data. He said the study's error rate was wrong because of an error in the research method."

Students' performance would be judged by a teacher and by a worker from the company helping the student.\nOne teacher explained why change was necessary. She said school is divided into subjects to learn, but our brain is not divided into subjects. She said students needed to think differently. They needed to think about the problems in the world. She questioned whether today's children get the skills to succeed in such an inter-cultural world.

EDCs are in most houses. Researchers say they can affect our health. Children are at most risk. EDCs can lead to learning problems. EDCs can increase the risk of cancer and infertility. The researchers say we need to look at all the things we make so that they do not make us unhealthy."

It is one-tenth of a millimeter long and has a very tough body. It can survive without food for decades, and exist in bitterly freezing and boiling temperatures. Water bears can also survive the pressure of deep oceans, the vacuum of outer space, nuclear war, global warming, or any other extreme events that would kill humans.\nScientists say water bears are so tough that only the Sun boiling all the Earth's oceans would kill them. This will happen in several billion years. A study says complex life is very difficult to destroy and could exist on other planets. It says that because water bears are so tough, it is possible for other tough creatures to be in the Universe. It said there was, \"a real case for looking for life on Mars and in other areas of the Solar System\"."

His research is in a book called 'Dirt is Good: The Advantage of Germs for Your Child’s Developing Immune System'. He said: \"It's fine to wash their hands….but if a dog licks their face, that's not a bad thing.\"\nDr Gilbert said letting children get dirty was good. The dirt helps babies to build their immune system. Children often get allergies because parents clean everything that children use. This makes children's immune systems weaker, which can cause asthma and food allergies. Gilbert said the \"five-second rule\" is OK. This is when you eat something that fell on the floor for fewer than five seconds. Gilbert says it is OK if the floor isn't really dirty."

        "Content": "Scientists often warn us about climate change, asteroids or nuclear war. Now scientists have warned of the threat of Earth's magnetic poles reversing. The poles create the magnetic shield around Earth. This protects us from deadly radiation. Life on Earth depends on this shield. The poles could flip in the next thousand years because the molten iron turning around Earth's center is changing direction. This molten iron is like a gigantic electromagnet.\nEarth's poles flip roughly every 250,000 years. The last time was 780,000 years ago. The next flip could destroy communications and power grids; deadly solar rays could increase rates of cancer; and climate change could kill many species. A polar flip could even blow Earth's atmosphere away. One scientist dismissed the danger from increased radiation from the poles flipping. He said it would be as harmful as lying on a beach for a day without wearing a hat."

        "Content": "Humans are shifting freshwater resources across Earth. This will continue as people move and eat more. Many equatorial regions are drying, while tropical areas are getting wetter. If this continues, many cities could struggle to find enough water in the future. NASA spent 14 years studying freshwater resources. It was part of a mission called GRACE, which stands for Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment.\nJay Famiglietti, a co-author of the research, said: \"The study shows that humans have really drastically altered the global water landscape in a very profound way.\" He warned that: \"We see it as a driver of climate change.\" Professor Famiglietti said that over 40 per cent of the hot areas looked at in the research were drier than twenty years ago. He said this was because of human activity. One reason was too much pumping of groundwater for farming."

It had more than three times the energy of dairy milk. It was also full of protein.\nMilking cockroaches for the human population isn't as easy as milking cows. An alternative is to recreate the milk in a lab, and then mass-produce it in factories. One company has already started selling insect-milk ice cream.

A worrying conclusion in the study is that global warming may affect the future income of students around the world. Researchers said that if global temperatures continued to rise, the average American student could lose $25,000 because of lower test scores. Air conditioning in classrooms could stop this.

A professor in biodiversity research said: \"The stinger of the new wasp...is not only long but also very wide, in comparison to the size of the species. It looks like a fierce weapon.\"\nSome wasps put larvae inside the insects they sting. The larvae grow and eat the insect from the inside. Most victims of this wasp are spiders. Further research will find out exactly which kinds of spiders. The professor explained the giant stinger was, \"a highly sophisticated tool\" and he could \"only guess at its other purposes\". He added: \"Beautiful and exciting species...catch people's attention and highlight the importance of...ecosystems.\""

The campaign group Action on Sugar wants the shake banned from restaurants as it has up to 1,280 calories. It would take three hours of jogging for an adult to burn off these calories. Freakshakes can contain 39 teaspoons of sugar - more than six times the recommended daily amount for a 10-year-old. This is the same as four cans of Coke.\nFreakshakes started in Australia and spread worldwide. A restaurant mentioned by Action on Sugar said it took nutrition seriously and was sticking to a sugar-reduction programme. It added: \"Freakshakes only feature on our main menu and are not targeted at children....We regularly work with our suppliers to explore ways we can reduce sugar levels in our dishes.\" A health spokesman said the government needed to limit shakes to 300kcal per serving."

UNICEF said around 169 million children worldwide have missed measles vaccinations. Measles killed 110,000 people (mostly children) in 2017, up 22 per cent from 2016. UNICEF said: \"The measles virus will always find unvaccinated children....We need to vaccinate every child.\"\nThe CDC blamed the anti-vaccination movement for the surge in measles cases. The anti-vaxxer movement began in 1763. Doctors believed vaccines were harmful. The anti-vaxxer message is spreading across social media. Facebook vowed to remove anti-vaxxer posts. The CDC said the anti-vaxxer movement spread misinformation about the safety of the measles vaccine. It said anti-vaxxers \"are deliberately targeting...communities\"."

Sepsis happens when our body puts too many chemicals into our blood to fight disease. The chemicals can damage our organs and kill us. Doctors once called this blood poisoning. Most sepsis cases are in children.\nA study in a medical journal said 50 million people a year get sepsis. Twenty per cent of these die. This is double what we thought. Sepsis kills more people than cancer. A doctor is \"alarmed\" because sepsis, \"is both preventable and treatable\". He wants to stop sepsis killing babies.

They use their noses to detect temperature, such as when predators or prey are nearby. Humans only know something is hot through touch. It was believed that dogs' noses are cold to control their body temperature.\nResearchers did experiments on dogs, which had to detect the temperature of different objects. Brain activity in the dogs showed that they knew which objects were warmer than others.

They have come up with a new formula that precisely finds out a dog's age. The new method needs more than simple mental arithmetic. It compares the changes of the DNA of dogs and humans. Scientists say DNA analysis is the best way to measure the ageing speed of dogs.\nResearchers tested blood from 105 dogs. After some number crunching, they created a graph to show dogs and people age at different rates. A one-year-old dog is similar to a 30-year-old human, while a four-year-old dog is like a 52-year-old. A researcher said: \"A nine-month-old dog can have puppies, so we already knew that the 1:7 ratio wasn't an accurate measure of age.\" He added that different breeds of dog age at different speeds."

The size of the protest made the government meet the protesters face-to-face rather than call in the police.\nIndia's farmers are furious about agricultural reforms that will shake up India's farming society. Farmers are accusing the government of ignoring them for the benefit of big agri-business. Their protests around Delhi look like a blockade of the city. A farmers' union said: \"We will block rail tracks if our demands are not met.\" It said agriculture was too important to play party politics with.

He said it is best to cut across the middle into two semicircles, then cut slices and push the remaining halves together.\nChristmas cake is an English tradition. It is full of raisins, orange rind and other dried fruit. The fruit is often soaked in brandy. It is common to cover the fruitcake base in a layer of marzipan, then coat the top and sides in a one-centimetre layer of icing. People decorate the top of the cake with Christmas symbols like fir trees or snowmen and women. Christmas cakes vary around the world.

It split from an ice shelf in 2017 and has been floating north ever since. A fast-moving stream of water in the Southern Antarctic has put the chunks on a course that could see them run aground off the South Georgia coast. Scientists say the three fragments are about 2,600 square kilometres in size.\nThe size of the chunks is a big threat to the South Georgia wildlife. It could be an environmental catastrophe. If they hit the seabed, they could block penguins and seals from looking for fish. They could also block routes to feeding grounds during the breeding season. The bottom of the chunks could rake up the seabed and disrupt delicate ecosystems. A mass of melting fresh water from the chunks over the summer could worsen this situation."

A change can cause slight differences in the DNA when it splits. A tiny change can create differences in height, intelligence, eye colour and in how easy it is to catch a disease.\nThe study shows that in about 15 per cent of identical twins, one twin had many mutations that the other did not have. This difference helps explain the \"nature versus nurture\" debate - whether socializing and upbringing affects human behaviour.

They are anchored in the Red Sea and Mediterranean near the ends of the canal. Authorities will try and double the daily average of ships to go through the channel.\nThere have been big efforts to free the 400-metre-long ship. Dredgers cleared sand underneath it to refloat it. Around 30 tug boats worked to pull it away from the canal's banks. A high tide helped the salvage operation. Egypt's president said it was a \"massive technical complexity\".

It used to be a carbon \"sink\" where CO2 disappeared. It is becoming a source of carbon dioxide. Reasons for this flipping from sink to source are deforestation and forest fires. Researchers predict the rainforest will create CO2 at an accelerating rate in the future. It was once called \"the lungs of the world\".\nResearchers analysed 600 profiles of CO2 emissions produced by fires in the Amazon between 2010 and 2018. The fires produced about 1.5 billion tons of CO2 a year, while the forest removed 0.5 billion tons. The billion-ton difference is the same as the annual emissions of Japan - the world's fifth-largest polluter. A researcher said: \"The south-east Amazon sink-to-source story is yet another stark warning that climate impacts are accelerating.\""

Any injuries you get on that journey is eligible for compensation. A rule was made in a case where a man slipped down his stairs from his bedroom to his home office and broke his back. The court said the \"first morning journey from bed to the home office is an insured work route\".The idea of what a workplace is changed after the pandemic. Millions of people are now working at home. This changes health and safety rules about the workplace and accidents. A question is who is responsible for ensuring a home office follows safety laws. Also, how much an employer is liable for injuries sustained in an employee's home. An expert on employment law said new legislation would be needed to decide future claims."

The researchers said: \"Only two differences were significant: the neurosurgeons' problem-solving speed was quicker and their memory recall speed was slower.\"The research questions the use of phrases such as \"this isn't rocket science\" or \"that isn't brain surgery\". These suggest something is easy to understand. The researchers said using 'It's not brain surgery' is OK when we need rapid problem solving, but not when rapid information recall is needed.

A study of 1,000 adults found that half of the participants were addicted to their smartphones and didn't realize it. The study called for people to try \"digital detox\".\nDigital detox involves turning off the Internet to enjoy \"real life\". It means talking to people face to face and \"doing everyday stuff\". A digital detox organisation said detox was \"a catalyst for people to rethink their distance from their devices\". People should use devices less to avoid \"nomophobia\" – NO MObile PHOBIA. A psychologist warned that being too absorbed in smartphones means ignoring responsibilities. She said people should consider digital detox."

Farmers are facing higher energy costs. It is more difficult for them to make a profit. In addition, a tomato disease has affected many farms across Europe. An expert said Brexit is also playing a part.

This has caused the North Pole to move. It is drifting by more than four centimetres a year. Professor Seo calculated that we used more than two trillion tons of groundwater between 1993 and 2010. This caused Earth to wobble.Groundwater affects Earth's gravity. Seo said: \"Every mass moving around on the surface of the Earth can change the rotation axis.\" Scientists previously thought water-driven shifts were caused by melting glaciers. Seo was puzzled at how this alone could cause a tilt. He concluded that underground water was also a factor. Most groundwater we use is for irrigation. Another researcher said: \"The very way the planet wobbles is impacted by our activities.\""

However, other animals are not as radioactive. They do not have as much radioactive caesium in their bodies. This has puzzled scientists. They dubbed this mystery the \"wild boar paradox\". They say the wild boars' radioactivity is from nuclear weapons tests from last century.Scientists believe wild boars are radioactive because of their love of truffles. These absorb caesium particles in the ground. The levels of caesium in boars mean they cannot be eaten. This has led to a reduction in the hunting of the animals and an increase in their numbers. A geochemist said he doesn't know why the effects of nuclear weapons testing on the environment has been \"largely forgotten\". He said soil pollution will \"haunt generations to come\"."

Insects usually use the moon to fly in straight lines. However, the artificial lights confused the bugs. They continuously flew around the lights in an erratic manner.

A U.K. geologist has found that 200-300 million years ago, when there was just a single landmass, it rained non-stop for up to two million years. This helped the development of flowers and animals all over the globe. The geologist believes the rain may have been caused by a huge rise in humidity following massive volcanic eruptions.The geologist based his findings on research conducted on ancient rock in Europe in the 1970s. There were strange deposits in the rock. The geologist said this suggests the long wet period may have been the \"trigger\" that allowed dinosaurs and modern animals to diversify. He added: \"It may have been one of the most important events in the history of life.\" It could be how many of the creatures we see today started, like turtles, crocodiles, lizards and mammals."

The other is voluntary work for one weekend a month. This means volunteering in the health, ambulance or fire services. The UK's leader wants young people to learn useful skills.Many people say national service is too expensive. There are not enough staff to train 30,000 army volunteers.

Research conducted by an eyewear store states eye colour surgery has a 92 per cent chance of problems. The surgery is the riskiest cosmetic procedure. Operations include a procedure called keratopigmentation. This is a permanent colour change in which a special dye is inserted into the eyes with lasers.An American eyecare group warned against eye colour change procedures. It said things can go wrong. These include dye leakage, allergic reactions, sensitivity to light, and blindness. It added: \"Anything that we do with the eyes, we have to be very, very cautious.\" An eye specialist said getting coloured contact lenses was better than surgery. She said this, \"can give you the look you want without putting your eye health at risk\"."
